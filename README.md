# MNIST Digit Classification

This project involves building and training a machine learning model using the MNIST handwritten digit dataset with Keras. The model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics, and performance is improved through optimization techniques such as regularization to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization.
